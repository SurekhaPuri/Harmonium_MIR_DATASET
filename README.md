# MIR_DATASETS

The MIR_DATASETS contains dataset of 10000 single notes scuh as A,A#,B,C,C#,D,D#,E,F,F#,G,G#,chords and mixed chords of Harmonium instrument.
Chords 
The proposed system emphasizes on the instrument which does not have the standard dataset readily available for the training the model for notes and chords together, so the dataset of notes and chords was created having per note 120 samples of 3 seconds approximating to 3600 seconds of notes dataset forming 1.5 GB of the dataset. For the polyphonic Chord dataset, per recording of every chord  is of 3 seconds on an average and per chord 500 samples were used for dataset creation. Overall, a total of 36 chords  were trained with a minimum of 500 samples per chord  of 3 seconds.
